Everyone knows the problem of P = NP. P represents a simple solution to the problem and NP represents a complex solution to the file.
Don't we need to prove that it's impossible? 
Because P is just a symbol, there is no specific reference. 
If you know what P stands for, or what P means, please let me know, thank youã€‚
